install instructions
⋅⋅*  npm install(might need sudo if you do not have enough permissions), this will install the dependencies
⋅⋅*  node server.js, this starts the server
⋅⋅*  navigate to localhost:8080 - test with text.txt in test folder
⋅⋅*  to test type mocha at the root directory 

more improvments could be made to make this more testable.
